%                         everything else
%  taskType : a string specifying which OUTPUT task to train on
%              dff      => 4 localist outputs, specifying whether one of two
%                          particular targets is at the local or global
%                          level (must be run with dff stimSet)

%                          to express all 6 conditions in the sergent stimSet.
%              mtl      => 6 outputs, distributed as follows:
%                          (2) a target is present at the local/global level
%                          (2) a distracter is present at the local/global level
%                          (2) the sergent task below
%              sergent  => (default) single output: is there a target?
%  opt      : a vector of options; all listed will be applied
%               reza-ized => switch one distracter with one target (to replicate published DE)
%               swapped  => switch all targets with all distracters
%                           (note: a better test is to switch one target
%                            with one distracter)

%OUTPUT: a data file with the following variables:

%  LpSm LmSp LpSp LmSm LpSpID LpSpNID LmSmID LmSmNID: indices representing the 8 different trial types
%
%  TALL:  index containing above 8 indices
%  TLBL : labels for all trial types, as indexed above
%
%  STIM : cell array containing each stimulus (usually 4: 2 targets, 2 distracters
%
%  train.X    : matrix containing 16 vectors, each a unique hierarchical stimulus.
%  train.TT   : 16 indices, one for each hierarchical stimulus, taken from TALL
%  train.ST   : vector of 16 strings, describing each unique hierarchical stimulus.
%               Tells the two stimuli and relationship that make up the hierarchical stimulus
%  train.TIDX : ?
%
%  train.Y    : target vectors for autoencoder (same as X)
%  train.T    : target vectors for perceptron (labels, based on task)
%
%  test.*     : same as train object, but
