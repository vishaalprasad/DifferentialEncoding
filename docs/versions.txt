3.17: 
  * changed connectivity patterns (grid-like 202 and 425 instead of lazier version which fails connecting all, more often)
  * made navon figures into bitmaps
  * made ac/p hash use datafile name
  * made uber christman use theta=0 (instead of pi/2)
  * added common_args.m (only working for 34x25)

  * did NOT implement "any size" for faces
  * want to migrate to larger size; Navon figure bitmaps are mucked up
