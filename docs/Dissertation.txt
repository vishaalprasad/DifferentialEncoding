Divided vs. focused attention:
================

Yovel et al (2001) exhaustively review studies presenting hierarchical letter stimuli laterally, and suggest that a key factor in whether a study elicits a significant hemisphere x level interaction is whether attention is divided across levels, or focused by the experimenter's specification of a level of processing.  Yovel et al argue that divided attention tasks elicit greater asymmetries than focused attention tasks.  Our model does not invoke attention, and is best thought of as a bottom-up processing model with general task-based attention for classification.  This is more like the divided attention model, which allows each hemisphere to process information in their "preferred" manner.  This is to contrast focused attention models, which require a hemisphere to exert some attentional effort to change how the processing occurs--our model has no such mechanism.  Thus, our model predicts asymmetries in divided attention tasks, and makes no prediction about focused attention tasks.

The DFF model does make direct reference to attention--both for general, task-based attention like ours, but also in the application of an attention-based asymmetry.  In the DFF, the selection of frequency band is symmetric between the hemispheres.  Since in the DFF the amount of asymmetry does not interact with the width of the task-relevant frequency band, and because the basic difference between divided and focused attention tasks would be the width of the task-relevant frequency band, the DFF does not predict any difference between them.

Early areas show no asymmetry:
================

Sergent (1982) and Ivry & Robertson (1998) argue that early areas show no asymmetry, as only "higher-level" categorization and recognition tasks show asymmetries, but detection tasks do not.  Similar arguments are made for face perception (Moscovitch et al, 1976; Moscovitch & Radzin, 1987) and word identification (Moscovitch, 1983).  [MV76: argue similar things for face perception--that "higher-order processes" show lateralization, but that "pre-categorization" processing does not].  Note that one model of the source and development of visual processing asymmetries (Howard and Reggia, 2007) suggest early areas (V2) should show asymmetry.

The DFF model simply implements this difference directly--"early" processing, where the input is processed by a set of spatial frequency filters, is completely symmetric, whereas task-based selection of those filter banks is asymmetric.

Our model can test these predictions directly.  Amir et al (1993) publish data showing that the spread of connections--both in connection length and over the visual field--increases as you traverse up the visual hierarchy.  We can implement this directly in our model by increasing the spread of connections in each hemisphere.  We can use our developmental model to prune connections based on inputs, and we can see whether the models show significantly different spreads in connections, or show differences in spatial frequency processing of images.

We have done this, and our data reflect those suggested in the literature: early areas have too little spread in connections, and any asymmetry is insignificant and does not affect spatial frequency processing.  As the spread of connections increases, the asymmetry increases as well.

Cortical magnification
================

We don't do central fixation.  What is the role of cortical magnification in these results?
Simoncelli (Portilla_Simoncelli_2000): estimating cortical magnification
Qui_etal_2006: estimating cortical magnification more directly/simply than Simoncelli
Yovel_etal_2001: suggests a possible effect of eccentricity, noting that small eccentricities seem to tend to show asymmetry, while wide are less likely (though the result is equivocal)

================
Human uniqueness
================

Hopkins has produced quite a bit of evidence in macaque monkeys and chimpanzees of the same types of hemispheric preferences in processing stimuli, such as a RH advantage for faces in chimpanzees (Morris and Hopkins, 1993), a global precedence for chimpanzees (but a local precedence for macaques) (Hopkins et al, 1990; Hopkins & Washburn, 2002)

Note, however, that tasks (and reaction times) are often drastically different than given to humans, owing to the difficulty with which to communicate/train task objectives to non-human primates.  The dependent measure also tends to be accuracy, rather than reaction time.

Why patches?
================

Koulakov_Chklovskii_2003: for ocular dominance, depends on the % of cell types.  if few, then you get patches.  how does this apply to non-ocular dominance?  not sure.
